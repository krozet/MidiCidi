# MidiCidi

This software is a VST MIDI plugin for Ableton (the industry standard Digital Audio Workstation software for musical development) that allows the user to change the C Major scale into any mode or scale they so choose. Simply select your Tonic and Mode and the program will read your MIDI input, through either a MIDI controller or Ableton&#39;s on-board keyboard, and manipulate the data to output the proper MIDI scale degree.

This is an entirely free piece of software that I developed alongside with Bradly Foster, a fellow aspiring Software Engineer and lifelong friend. We aimed to fuse two of our greatest passions in our life into one project - programming and music. Coded entirely in C++, MidiCidi demonstrates I/O operations, an interactive GUI, and precise processing of collected data.
